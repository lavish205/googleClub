			    	<h3>Welcome to the recruitment page!</h3><br><br>

			    	In order to join the Google Club, one must know what exactly Google Club does? What are the goals of the club and how hard we work to achieve them!<br>

			    	At Google Club, we never ask you to do anything that you don't want to. :) Instead we encourage students to do what they are best at, to take their own initiatives. We shall support them with resources in the best possible manner. For more queries please visit our <a href="contact.html">'Contact Us' </a>page.<br>

			    	Google Club is officially affiliated with the web giant of the world - <b>Google</b>. Here we have to maintain the quality of our brand. It's not like we're looking for only highly skilled and experienced students to work with us. What we rather demand is a positive learning attitude bundled with responsible behaviour and professionalism. However for the extended core team, our priority is to recruit only skilled students so that we can up-skill them in a short time. Our volunteer team shall consist of those student who are mainly interested in learning with us from the very basic along side gaining an experience of working in a highly professional environment.<br><br>

			    	The Google club will consist of following verticals:<br>
			    	<ol>
			    		<li><u>Core Team</u></li>
			    		<li><u>Extended Core Team</u></li>
			    		<li><u>Volunteer Team</u></li>
			    	</ol>

			    	  We are affiliated to a brand and our focus<mark>will be on quality of student instead of quantity of students</mark>. Therefore, we will be very selective with our applications.<br>

			    	Please don't apply just because your friends have applied or you want your name added to something big. You should know what you're applying for. Any neglence or unresponsiveness of the student at any point shall lead to his disqualification from the team. The thing to keep in mind during application process is - "BE YOURSELF".<br></br>

			    	Thanks for showing your interest in joining Google Club. All the best.<br>
