			   	Welcome to the recruitment page!<br></br>

			    	In order to join the Google Student Club one must know what exactly a Google Club does? What are goals of the club and how hard we work to realise them!!<br>

			    	At Google Club, we never ask you to do anything that you don't want to :) Instead we encourage students to do what they are best at , to take their own initiatives. We shall  support them with resources in the best possible manner. <br><br>For further queries please visit our <a href="about.html">'Keynotes' </a>page or write to us at <a href="contact.html">'Contact Us'</a> page<br><br>

			    	Google Club is <b>officially affiliated</b> to the web giant of the world - <b>'Google'</b>.<br> Here we are to  maintain the quality of our brand.It is not like we are looking for only skilled and experienced students.What we rather we demand is a positive learning attitude bundled with responsibile behaviour and professionalism. However, for the extended core team, our priority is to recruit only skilled students whom we can up-skill within a short time. Our volunteer team shall consist of those student who are mainly interested in learning with us from very basic along side gaining an experience of working in a highly professional environment.<br>

			    	<br>Google Student Club will comprise of the following verticals:<br>
			    	<ol>
			    		<li><u>Core Team</u></li>
			    		<li><u>Extended Core Team</u></li>
			    		<li><u>Volunteer Team</u></li>
			    	</ol>

			    	Note:We are a brand and we focus on quality rather than quantity.So we will be very selective with our applications.<br>

			    	Please don't apply just because your friends have applied or you want to name yourself in something big. You should know what you're applying for. Any student found under neglence at any point of his tensure shall stand disqualified. The thing to keep in mind during the application process and in later contributions is - "ALWAYS BE YOURSELF".<br>

			    	Thanks, for showing interest in joining Google Club. All the best.<br>
