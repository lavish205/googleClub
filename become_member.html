			    	 Hi! Welcome to the recruitment page!<br>

			    	In order to join Google Club, I believe you deserve to know what exactly Google Club does? What are goals of the club and how do we work hard to achieve them?<br>

			    	At Google Club, we never ask you to do anything that you don't want to. :) We encourage students to do what they want and take their own initiatives. We support them. For common answers please visit our 'Connect Us' page.<br>

			    	Google Club is officially connected with web giant of the world - Google. Here we maintain the quality of our brand. It's not like we're looking for only heavily skilled and experienced students to work with us. But we demand a positive and good learning attitude inside you with responsibility and professionalism. However for extended core team,  our priority is to recruit only skilled students so that we can up-skill them. Our volunteer team consist of those student who are mainly interested in learning with us from basics and want to gain an experience of working in a highly professional environment.<br>

			    	Therefore we will be dividing selected students in the following three teams:<br>
			    	<ol>
			    		<li>Core Team</li>
			    		<li>Extended Core Team</li>
			    		<li>Volunteer Team</li>
			    	</ol>

			    	Again, please know that we are a brand and <mark>we focus on quality of student instead of quantity of students</mark>. So we'd be very selective in our application process.<br>

			    	Please don't apply just because your friend has applied or you want to join something big. You should know what you're applying for and one thing to keep in mind during application process is - "BE YOURSELF".<br>

			    	Thanks for showing your interest in joining Google Club. All the best.
			    </p>
