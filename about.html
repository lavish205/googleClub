						<ul>
							<li>Students will get an environment of applied learning and have better awareness for all kinds of technical and non-technical events on and off-campus.</li>
							<li>Students will have the awareness of various  programs of Google such as Scholarships for women and Internship in Google.</li>
							<li>There is no such  community in college to whom students can go and ask for their career related or technical queries. Hence GSC would act as the community who would help students for the same.</li>
							<li>Students can get placed in Google with consistent working. They lack awareness of how they can be placed. Club will help themselves and students to get placed in Google.</li>
							<li>Students will learn judicious use of technology and Google apps for education that actually make learning very easy.</li>
							<li>Students will come together to take part in Coding Challenges too. Presently there is no coding culture in college. We mostly code in labs, and thatâ€™s it. Club would help in promoting coding as well as app development skills in students.</li>
							<li>Google Goodies/Swags and Certificates to best  performers.</li>
							<li>There are many other benefits of having a club of students in campus who with support of college authority can make the college a better learning place. Students will come up with new achievements, mobile applications, websites of their own.</li>
